### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is PostgreSQL?
  PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system  known for its reliability, robustness, and advanced features. It supports SQL for querying and managing data and is highly extensible, allowing users to define custom data types, functions, and more.

- What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?
  SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language used for managing and querying relational databases. 

- In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?

- What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`?
  The WHERE clause is used to filter rows before groups are applied, while the HAVING clause is used to filter groups after the grouping has been done. In other words, WHERE is applied before the aggregation (e.g., GROUP BY), whereas HAVING is applied after the aggregation.

- What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join?
  An INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables being joined based on the join condition. An OUTER JOIN, on the other hand, returns all rows from both tables being joined, with NULLs in places where there is no match.

- What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join?
  In a LEFT OUTER JOIN, all rows from the left table (the first table mentioned in the query) are returned, along with matching rows from the right table. In a RIGHT OUTER JOIN, all rows from the right table are returned, along with matching rows from the left table.

- What is an ORM? What do they do?
  An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that converts data between incompatible type systems (object-oriented programming languages and relational databases). It maps objects from the application code to tables in a relational database, abstracting away the details of the database and allowing developers to work with objects directly.

- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX 
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?
  
  AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests are made from the client-side (typically within a web browser) using JavaScript, allowing dynamic updates of a web page without reloading the entire page. requests, on the other hand, is a Python library used to make HTTP requests from the server-side.
  
  AJAX requests are asynchronous, meaning the rest of the page can continue to load and function while waiting for a response from the server, while server-side requests with requests typically block until a response is received.
  
  AJAX requests are subject to the same-origin policy, meaning they can only make requests to the same domain as the page making the request, unless CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers are properly set up. Server-side requests with requests do not have this restriction.

- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?
  CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack where a malicious website tricks a user's browser into performing actions on another website where the user is authenticated. A CSRF token is a unique token generated by the server and included in forms or HTTP requests. The purpose of the CSRF token is to mitigate CSRF attacks by ensuring that the request originated from the same site and was not forged by a malicious third-party.

- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?
In Flask, form.hidden_tag() is used to generate a hidden field containing a CSRF token within a WTForms form. This hidden field ensures that the CSRF token is included in the form submission, allowing the server to verify the authenticity of the form submission and mitigate CSRF attacks.
